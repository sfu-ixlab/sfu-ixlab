### About the Lab

The Interactive Experiences Lab (ixLab) at Simon Fraser Universityâ€™s School of Computing Science specializes in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Visualization (InfoVis). Using an interdisciplinary, human-centered approach, we invent, design, prototype and study novel interactive data visualization and computing systems with the overt intention to empower people, helping to make it more possible for them to tackle technology and data challenges in a variety of domains.

Xing-Dong Yang is an Associate Professor in human-computer interaction (HCI) at the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University. He investigates future interactive systems and brings interactivity to everyday objects. His work focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of novel interactive systems for smart everyday “things”, ranging from watches to garments, accessories, appliances, and furniture. Aside from contributing new systems and knowledge to the field, I use the experiences from my own research to inform the investigation of prototyping tools to enable broader participation of research activities in my field for people without a strong background in electronics, sensors, or actuators.

Victor Cheung is a Lecturer of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University. Before becoming a lecturer, he joined the Creative Interactions Lab (CIL) at Carleton University as a postdoc fellow focusing on tangible and wearable computing, followed by two consecutive postdoc fellowships with Tangible Embodied Child-Computer Interaction Lab (TECI Lab) and Interactive Experiences Lab (ixLab) at Simon Fraser University expanding his research in various fields within Human-Computer Interaction. As lecturer, he teaches a wide range of courses from introduction to programming to user interface design and special topics in HCI. Both his teaching and research interests involve designing and evaluating technologies that mediate communications between humans and also computers, resulting in improved user experience and user empowerment.

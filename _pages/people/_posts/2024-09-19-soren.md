I am a Marie Curie Postdoctoral scholar with Dr. Hude Quan and Dr. Catherine Eastwood at the Centre for Health Informatics with a secondary affiliation to Dr. Sheelagh Carpendale's former InnoVis group at the Interactions Lab at Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary. My research focuses on information visualization and human-computer interaction. I am interested in supporting people in understanding and making sense of healthcare data. My dissertation research concerned understanding the benefits of using large, high-resolution displays to support this goal through interaction techniques and data visualization.

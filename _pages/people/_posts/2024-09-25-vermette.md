I'm a third-year PhD student studying Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, supervised by Dr. Parmit Chilana and Dr. Joanna McGrenere. My research seeks to understand educators' practices and motivations as they integrate a growing variety of software tools into their teaching and learn to customize those tools to better suit their classroom needs. From these insights, I design novel systems that help educators discover, explore, and implement relevant software customizations that improve the utility and usability of their digital classroom ecosystems.

Nick Vincent is an Assistant Professor in human-centered artificial intelligence. Much of his research focuses on understanding how data records -- including works that we produce and logs of our behavior -- provide value to AI systems such as search engines, recommender systems, and new "generative AI" systems, and how the benefits of data-dependent AI might flow back to the public. A key idea motivating his work is that because human activities are upstream of the data contributions that make AI work, organized groups can exert "data leverage" to bargain for larger shares of the profits of AI or for more voice in how AI systems are governed.

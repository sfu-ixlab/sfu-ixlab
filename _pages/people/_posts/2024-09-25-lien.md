I am a well-rounded UX designer who crafts thoughtful products by listening to people and designing solutions to enhance their experiences. My interests are creating delightful user experiences, designing fun data visualizations, and learning more about people. I work with Sheelagh doing research in Spatial Thinking, and Data Stories.
